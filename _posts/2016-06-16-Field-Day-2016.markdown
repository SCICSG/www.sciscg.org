SCICSG will once again be participating in Amateur Radio Field Day this year.


Field Day is an annual event which combines an on-air contest, an emergency communications exercise and a public relations opportunity through the display and operation of amateur radio stations, often in public sites. The event starts on Saturday afternoon and runs through the night and into Sunday afternoon.


This year, SCICSG will be operating from the lawn of The Rock church at 3990 Rocky Ford Road (corner of Rocky Ford and Taylor Rd) in Columbus.
Setup will begin around 10:00am on Saturday, June 25, with on-air operations occurring between 2:00pm Saturday and 2:00pm Sunday.


Multiple stations will be in operation during the event with the Charles Long Memorial Station acting as our GOTA (Get on the Air) station. The GOTA station will be available for those who have earned their amateur radio license within the past year and for those who are not licensed and have an interested in getting on the air and participating, under the supervision of a license amateur radio operator.


The public is welcome at any time during the event.
