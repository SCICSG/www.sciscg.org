Weâ€™re pleased to announce that, as of Tuesday, April 21, SCICSG has accepted the role of trustee of the three Brown County repeaters (53.090-, 147.300+, 443.275+).

We look forward to providing the same excellent service to the amateur radio community that Pete, KA9SWI has provided for years.

We will be having some additional exciting announcements about these repeaters in the near future.
