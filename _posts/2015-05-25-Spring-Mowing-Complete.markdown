On Saturday, May 23, several members of SCICSG volunteered their time to mow the tower site where the Columbus Amateur Radio Club’s 440 repeater is housed. 

SCICSG does the mowing and trimming of the site in support of CARC’s repeater each May and September as part of CARC’s lease agreement with the tower owner.

Thank you to all members who dedicated about two hours of their holiday weekend for the effort. It is greatly appreciated!
