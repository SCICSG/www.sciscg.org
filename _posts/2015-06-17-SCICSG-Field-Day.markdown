SCICSG will once again be participating in Amateur Radio Field Day on Saturday and Sunday, June 27 and 28, 2015.

This yearâ€™s event will take place on the grounds of our new sponsor, THE ROCK, the church at the corner of Rocky Ford Road and Taylor Road in Columbus, Indiana.

Beginning at 09:00 on Saturday, members will setup temporary ham radio stations to showcase the science and skill of Amateur Radio and its usefulness during emergency situations requiring communications support.

On-air operation will commence at 14:00 (2:00 pm) and continue throughout the night, concluding at 14:00 (2:00 pm) on Sunday.

One of the goals will be to contact as many other Amateur stations as possible throughout North America during this 24 hour period.

Current plans are to have all radio equipment powered exclusively by solar-charged battery packs with at least six radios operating from the Columbus event.

A Special station will be setup for the Public, with the guidance of a licensed operator,  to get hands-on experience and actually get on the air!

Please come out and join us!
